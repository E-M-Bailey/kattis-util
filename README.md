# kattis-util
An *unofficial* collection of Python/CLI utilities for interfacing with the Kattis online judge. Not related to https://github.com/Kattis/kattis-utils.

This requires a .kattisrc file in the repo root directory or a couple of other places; see [here](https://github.com/Kattis/kattis-cli) for details. To download a default .kattisrc file, see [here](https://open.kattis.com/download/kattisrc).

In addition to those present by default, several fields may be added to the `.kattisrc` file. See `example.kattisrc`.
